# Online-Multivariate-Empirical-Mode-Decomposition-OMEMD---based-on-IMF-mergin-with-FFT 
The code used in the master thesis ___.

This algorithm is a online version of MEMD that is more ressitant to mode splitting then the classical MEMD.

The code in the directory "MEMD-Python-master" is a copy of the MEMD algorithm from @mariogrune and can be found here: https://github.com/mariogrune/MEMD-Python-
